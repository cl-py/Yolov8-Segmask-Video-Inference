# Yolov8-Segmask-Video-Inference
Code forked from YoloV8 documentation. The purpose is to detect and segment a class from a given video, and then produce a .png mask for every frame in the video.
 
Usage of this code requires model trained on the following colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov8-instance-segmentation-on-custom-dataset.ipynb
